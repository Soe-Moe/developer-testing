## Overview

This project is a real estate property search feature built with Next.js, MySQL, and GraphQL. The application allows users to filter properties based on sale or rent, price range, number of bedrooms, and area. It is designed to handle a large number of properties (10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000) to test query performance. The listing page includes features like project name, short title, price, bedroom count, area, short description, and an interactive image gallery that works on both PCs and mobile devices.
